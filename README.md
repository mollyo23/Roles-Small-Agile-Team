# Roles-Small-Agile-Team
The roles of individuals on small agile team 

## Introduction

These are teams who have 15 or less members. All agile teams are considered whole teams, this means that each member of the team has a specific and sufficient skill in order to get the work done. Some of the different skills include testing, database, and user interface.

The team is mostly formed of generalizing specialists. This is someone who has one or more technical skills they can bring to the team. It is important to contribute your specific skill to the team, but to also learn new skills in your specific speciality as well as new domains. 

Agile teams are also very stable. They know that in order for a project to be successful they need to sometimes change team structure. This means that one week you might be on a one team working on a certain project and the next week you change to a different team that is working on an entrely new project. This is why it's important to have generalizable specialists, so they can easily move from one team to another. 

Part of an agile team is that any given person has one or more roles and they can switch roles over time. Any given role can have zero people or more than one person at any given point in the project. 

## There are four common roles in a small agile team:

1. Team lead "Scrum Master"
- Responsible for facilitating the team, obtaining resouces, and protecting it from problems. This role obtains the soft skills, but not the technical ones of project management. It does not include planning or scheduling, that is better left for the team as a whole to decide. 

2. Team member
- Sometimes refered to as developer or programmer, they are responsible for the creation of the system. This includes modeling and programming as well as other activites. 

3. Product owner
- Referred to as on-site customer in XP and active stakeholer in AM, represents the stakeholders. This is the only person responsible for the prioritized work item list. This is a list that is used for making decisions and providing information in a timely manner. You want to focus on completing tasks that have a higher priority and are a good size for your projects time period.

4. Stakeholder
- Anyone who is a direct user, indirect user, manager of users, and many more people who are potenially affected by the development and/or deployment of a software project. 

## Supporting Cast

Along with the four common roles of the agile team, there are also three supporting roles underneath them.

1. Technical Experts
- Sometimes teams need help setting up build masters to create their build scripts or an agile DBA to help design and test their database. These experts are brought in on an as-needed, temporary basis to help the team overcome a difficult problem.

2. Domain Experts
- Sometimes the product owner will bring in domain experts to work with the team, such as a tax expert to explain the details of a requirement or a sponsoring executive to explain the vision. 

3. Independent Tester
- This is an optional role and is typically only used and adopted for very complex projects. They usually validate the teams work throughout the life cycle of the project.
